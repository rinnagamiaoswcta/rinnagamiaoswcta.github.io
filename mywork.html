		<h2>Freshman Year</h2>
		
		<h3>Colorize</h3>
		<div class="flower"></div>
		<p class="indent">This was one of the first assignments we did in photoshop in graphic design. We were learning the basics of photoshop and started with how to edit photos. In this lesson we were learning how to edit black and white photos into colorized ones, realistic enough to make them look like that was how they were originally taken. We learned a lot on different types of brushes to use when colorizing photos and which setting to use. With this assignment I took a black and white flower and turned it into a multi-colored one.</p>
		<p class="indent">Looking back at this assignment I was pretty satisfied with how it came out to be. I liked the color selection I decided to go with in colorizing this photo. Though the transition to the next colored petal wasn’t the smoothest I’m content with how I selected each petal to be colorized, none of the colors interfered into the next petal. I also like how I added detail in the depth of the lower petals behind the ones in the front into more dark or muted colors. Overall I thought this was a big improvement in my skills as a graphic designer because I actually grasped the concept and understood it easily.</p>

		<h3>Gold Lettering</h3>
		<div class="font"></div>
		<p class="indent">After we had moved on from the basic skills in photoshop we tried to create more advanced graphics. With this assignment we had watched a video on how to turn ordinary text into an improved, eye-catching graphic. While I was first doing this it was without a doubt a bit hard. There were so many things that went into making an ordinary font into a golden graphic. But despite the struggle I was able to pull through.</p>
		<p class="indent">This assignment was helpful when it came to converting a flat text into a textured version. I learned a lot on where the natural light would hit on a shiny surface and where shadows would be on chiseled angles. This assignment also taught me that you can take anything and turn it into something better. Overall this assignment was fun to do and watch something like my name be turned into gold letters, though it’s only on a screen sadly.</p>

		<h2>Sophomore Year</h2>
		
		<h3>World History Poster</h3>
		<div class="whp"></div>
		<p class="indent">I made this poster back in World History for a project. Our task was to show child labor through a picture that was symbolic and not necessarily upfront. I learned a lot about child labor back then and how many young kids were under harmful circumstances when working in the factory. What really surprised me was the age that these kids could be working at and for such a low pay so I wanted portray that in the drawing.</p>
		<p class="indent">The poster symbolizes how young a child could be when working in the factories. With the baby next to a stroller and a hammer in hand, it symbolizes that their childhood was taken from them and in a way forced to grow up. The dirt on the child’s face shows how unclean the working conditions were in the factories that they were working in. The stroller next to the child shows that instead of living their childhood where they belong, instead they are playing with their new “toys” which are the tools. I’m happy with how this drawing came out because I thought it really delivered the message of child labor well.</p>

		<h3>Foreign Website</h3>
		<div class="chile"></div>
		<p class="indent">In the first year of web design one of our major projects was creating a website for tourists. It was a collaboration project with a foreign language class and as the web designers we had to design a website based off the content given from the foreign language class. During this project we had to think about the flow of the website like what would go into the navigation bar and how we would display the information. Other factors that were new to us that we had to include was the ability to translate the website from English to the foreign language it was appointed to. This whole project was done within our class groups.</p>
		<p class="indent">I thought that this was a good collaboration project despite how stressful it was. This project really taught us that many factors play a role into designing a website. We had to make a website that symbolized the location through the images we used and the color scheme we chose. It was a fun project to do overall. We learned how to fix problems that we ran into like text against busy backgrounds easier for the user to read. Also along this project we learned a lot on another country in the process.</p>

		<h3>Japan Collab</h3>
		<div class="jpan"></div>
		<p class="indent">In graphic design we had the opportunity to collaborate with these students from Japan to animate their stories that they had written for English class. The stories from the Japanese students were shared with us online and taken into our hands to animate. At the time we were learning how to use flash to animate graphics that we’ve made and we were now incorporating those skills into this collaboration. For this project we were partnered up and chose a story to animate and went through the whole process on how to bring it to life.</p>
		<p class="indent">Though this project ended up not being completed due to miscommunication it was fun to do. I learned a lot on concept art which is what the picture above is. The process of making a “movie” was fun like making storyboards or sketching out characters. The final product was not able to be animated again due to miscommunication between us and the students in Japan. But during the whole project we got to talk to full time animators and artists who did it for a living.</p>

		<h3>Classroom Poster</h3>
		<div class="poster"></div>
		<p class="indent">With this assignment we were given the opportunity to create posters for a new teacher. The teacher gave us concept ideas and quotes that he would like the poster to include. Later on the poster that he chooses will be printed out and hung on his walls of the new classroom. While doing this collaboration we really had to think outside the box with what was given to us, we had to think of a way on how to display these features in a unique and attractive way. This assignment made us students really feel like we had a consumer which caused us to carry it in such a professional way.</p>
		<p class="indent">With the poster I made the teacher wanted the quote, “When you enter this room, be prepared to leave your comfort zone.”, to be incorporated. I used different sizes on the words to make the important ones pop out like the words comfort zone. This assignment really taught me about the placement of text and that the size of the lettering can really make a difference. We make other words or letters pop out to emphasize the significance or focal point of the design. In the end I am satisfied with how it turned out though it did not end up getting chosen to be hung in the classroom.</p>

		<h3>Website Advertisement</h3>
		<div class="ad"></div>
		<p class="indent">This was an assignment given in graphic design as a part to incorporate into our tourist websites. We were given the task to make online advertisements for our website so that people will visit it. The ads included attractions of the country the website was on and as well as entertainment. Some of the requirements were to have a call to action or something to grab the user’s attention to click on the ad. Through this assignment I had learned many new things.</p>
		<p class="indent">Looking back at this assignment I thought it was fun to have the opportunity to design ads. This whole project in general taught me a lot on what factors go into making a website that I never knew, especially in this case which is ads. I also learned different types of ads like ones that take up a whole page or ones that are animated into making it look like they are manipulating the web page. I like how my ad turned out and I feel like it portrayed the calming aspect of Puerto Rico’s sunset. This assignment was fun to experiment with and experience.</p>

		<h3>Website Avatar</h3>
		<div class="avatar"></div>
		<p class="indent">This assignment went along with the tourist website we had to make but for this one specifically our task was to make our own avatar. The avatar was meant to be a guide throughout the whole website. In our own group all of us individually had to make an avatar that will eventually be the “host” of the website. Along with making our avatar we had to draw them in different positions and angles. This was a fun and easy assignment overall.</p>
		<p class="indent">In my design of the avatar I chose to make mine a pinata. I chose to design the avatar into a pinata because it had a lively vibe and was versatile with appearance. The pinata is a well known party decoration so I thought that I would make the avatar something the user would be able to recognize or relate to easily. I designed my avatar in different poses and apparel to match with a each category within the website. For example for the traveling part of the site I would have the avatar dressed up as a tourist or have luggage. Overall this was a fun and easy assignment to do.</p>

		<h3>English Variety Show</h3>
		<div class="show"></div>
		<p class="indent">This assignment was given to us in English class while we were studying the story of Romeo and Juliet. Our task for this project was to create our own variety show and incorporate the characters from the novel into it with an overall theme. In the varirty we had to include games for the guests to play and as well as have a script to follow along to. The variety show had to be fun and flow smoothly while still being entertaining. We also had to have some sort of graphic to accompany the show while it was going on.</p>
		<p class="indent">Looking back at this project it was really fun to do! My group chose to go with the theme of secrets can kill since there was a lot of betrayal in the book. In our variety show we had two games that the guests would play. We had the guests play never have I ever and give advice to viewers who sent in letter to the show host. The characters we decided to include were Romeo, Juliet, Nurse, and Friar Larence. 

		<h3>Typography</h3>
		<div class="typography"></div>
		<p class="indent">For this assignment in graphic design we were given the task to create our own lesson plan. We had to chose a subject in graphic design that we could use in a project and in collaborative work between classes. We had to watch a video of the topic we chose on Lynda and make a presentation of it. The presentation consisted of a short explanation of the subject we chose to pick and a lesson plan. With this assignment we also had to provide our own example of the lesson plan being in action.</p>
		<p class="indent"> I made my lesson plan a collaboration between an English class and a Graphic Design class. The English class would be provided an assignment to make a poem on any word of their choosing as long as it is school appropriate. The poem would be talking about how the word that they chose means to them or what kind of feeling the word gives off to them. After the students in English have completed that assignment the poem would later on be passed onto the Graphic Design students to make and design a font that would match with the emotion, feeling, and or tone of the writer’s poem. After the Graphic Design students have completed their task, the final product will later on be passed back to the English the students to be used as the title/ header of their final draft of their poem.</p>



		<h2>Junior Year</h2>

		<h3>Web App Game</h3>
		<div class="ship"></div>
		<p class="indent">This was an assignment given in web where we had joined a challenge online to create an app. The contest was called the Congressional App Challenge and our whole class had participated in it. The app had to help students or people for their everyday troubles. In this project we went through the whole process of brainstorming ideas to actually coding and making the app in MIT App Inventor.</p>
		<p class="indent">By far out of all the projects given to me this was a very stressful project to do. With this project we were introduced to new material which was on how to code or make an app. But thankfully most of this project didn’t involve much coding but more of dragging and dropping within the MIT App Inventor. My group and I made a game called Shipwreck in which kids get shipwrecked onto an island and the only way they could return home is if they help the natives clean up their island. Though my group’s app did not win the challenge it was a fun experience and I would do it again!</p>

		<h3>Company Logo</h3>
		<div class="logo"></div>
		<p class="indent">In all of the graphic design projects I had done this one was by far my favorite. In this project we had to form our own design firm and create our own logo, business cards, letter heads and envelopes. We had to create a mission statement, target audience and decide on what specifically we had to offer as a company. This whole project was to basically teach us students how it is to run a company in real life and a lot of the skills we learned were used in this. The first step of this project though was to develop a logo.</p>
		<p class="indent">The name of my group’s design firm was called Uprise and our mission statement was, “Ascend to Creativity”. With that being said we had to think of a way on how to incorporate that into our logo design. With my designs I was experiencing a lot with blue tones and borders. Our company wanted the logo to be simple and professional. Overall with this project I thought it was fun because through these assignments I believe you learn more what they do in the industry in real life.</p>

		<h3>Business Cards</h3>
		<div class="card"></div>
		<p class="indent">This assignment was given in graphic design and was part of the design firm project. After we had gotten our mission statement, target audience, and logo down we moved on to the media. We had to design our company’s business cards to fit our concept and overall company image. Through this assignment we learned a lot by trial and error. This assignment is also done in a setting where you really are just a new company trying to get their name out there.</p> 
		<p class="indent">This assignment was quite tricky because the amount of space you were given on a business card versus the amount of information to be included was hard to incorporate. It was hard to single out what information you did and did not need on a business card. The factor on how to display that information was also quite hard. We had to include point of contact while making it still visually appealing. With the business cards that I had created I ended up liking the front side better than the back side where all the info was placed.</p>

		<h3>Envelope</h3>
		<div class="envelope"></div>
		<p class="indent">This assignment is a continuation of the one in graphic design where we had to make our own design firm. After making a logo next we had to make different types of mixed media to put our company's information on. The media included a business cards, envelope, and letterhead. We had to keep in mind our misson statement with any of the designs of the mixed media we made. Through this assignment my group and I learned a lot on how it felt to be a starting business.</p>
		<p class="indent">With the envelope I had designed I didn't want the graphics to clutter the information that had to be placed. In my design I just kept it simple and added a few blue strokes to the border to direct the attention to the information. It was hard to make simple yet professional designs on the mixed medias overall because we had to make room if there was any text placed there. We also had include factors like point of contact and our website. In the end this was very fun to mess around in and experience.</p>

		<h3>Letterhead</h3>
		<div class="letterhead"></div>
		<p class="indent">This assignment is a continuation of the one in graphic design where we had to make our own design firm. After making a logo next we had to make different types of mixed media to put our company's information on. The media included a business cards, envelope, and letterhead. We had to keep in mind our misson statement with any of the designs of the mixed media we made. Through this assignment my group and I learned a lot on how it felt to be a starting business.</p>
		<p class="indent">With the letterhead I had designed I didn't want the graphics to clutter the information that had to be placed. In my design I just kept it simple and added a few blue strokes to act as the border to direct the attention to the information. It was hard to make simple yet professional designs on the mixed medias overall because we had to make room if there was any text placed there. We also had include factors like point of contact and our website. In the end this was very fun to mess around in and experience.</p>

		<h3>Web App PBL</h3>
		<div class="livit"></div>
		<p class="indent">For the Web App PBL we were given the task to create an app that would help students in school and teach that to 5th graders and 7th graders. This whole PBL included our group to make a whole lesson plan to teach the kids on how to make the app using MIT App Inventor. The students in the web class had to make an app that related to school whether it be for study breaks or planning but not too complicated that the kids who came wouldn’t be able to do it.</p>
		<p class="indent">For my group’s app we taught the kids on how to make your own affirmations with the affirmations app we had designed and made for them. The name of our app was called LivIt and it was a daily affirmations app that provided you affirmations to read everyday depending on what mood you were in to provide encouragement. The app also allows you to create your own affirmations and send them to your friends. Above are the few examples of the affirmations the kids had made that day.</p>

		<h3>Winter Escape</h3>
		<div class="winter"></div>
		<p class="indent">For this assignment we were given in web design to make our own website with a theme of winter escapes. The whole website was basically a winter resort. On this project though we mainly focused on making the websites responsive. The website we made had to be able to be printed in black and white, responsive, and etc.</p>
		<p class="indent">In the past years in web design I was very confused on many aspects of coding but after this assignment it gave me a better understanding of what I was doing. My website consisted of four main subjects to navigate over but 2-3 sub navs for further detail. Though I know it’s not the best website out there I learned a lot on coding and improved my skills in web design. It was a fun assignment to do and to look back on.</p>

		<h3>Fair Use Flyer</h3>
		<div class="flyer"></div>
		<p class="indent">In graphic design this was one of our first assignments to do with our company groups aside from designing the mixed media. For this assignment we had to create graphics for a fair use campaign using a certain art style. We had to make the campaign simple and easy for someone who had no knowledge of what fair use was. The campaign had to have it displayed on a flyet, poster, and on a single fold. This was a fun assignment to do and helped us students learn a lot more on fair use.</p>
		<p class="indent">In my group I was in charge to make a flyer. Our company decided to show fair use through the parody of superheros in the campaign. In my flyer, though I only have the front side done, I parodied the green arrow and provided information on what fair use was and how parody fell under it. Our company also chose to go with art deco as our theme to implement into the campaign. This assignment as of now is fun and interesting because little by little we are learning what fair use really it.</p>

		<h3>EOC Flyers</h3>
		<div class="eocflyer"></div>
		<p class="indent">In web design this was one of our first assignments to do with our company groups aside from designing the mixed media. For this assignment we had to create flyer ads for our EOC website. We had to make the campaign simple and easy for someone who had no knowledge of what our website was for. The campaign had to have it displayed on a flyer, poster, and on a single fold. This was a fun assignment to do and helped us students learn a lot more on fair use.</p>
